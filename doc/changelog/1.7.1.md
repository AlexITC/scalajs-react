# 1.7.1

* Add `AsyncCallback.barrier` which returns:

    ```scala
    final case class Barrier(waitForCompletion: AsyncCallback[Unit], complete: Callback)
    ```

* Deprecate `getDerivedStateFromProps` as step 2 (i.e. before `.render`) as it doesn't just get called when props change,
  it gets called when state changes too; meaning it gets reset every time you call setState (!).
  Use `getDerivedStateFromPropsAndState` instead.

* Reusability
  * Add `Reusability.disableGloballyInDev()` to globally disable `Reusability` in `fastOptJS`
  * Add an implicit `Reusability` instance for `ArraySeq` (Scala 2.13 only)
  * Add instances for everything in `java.time` and `scala.concurrent.duration`.
    * If the data type contains a time, then you can either:
      * specify a tolerance and create your own implicit instance (eg. `Reusability.finiteDuration(1 second)`)
      * `import Reusability.TemporalImplicitsWithoutTolerance._`
    * If the data type doesn't contain a time, then it's implicitly available out-of-the-box
  * `Reusability.derive` can now generate instances for recursive data types
  * Add `Reusability.byName[A](f: => Reusability[A]): Reusability[A]` which re-evaluates its argument on each invocation

* StateSnapshot
  * Bugfix: remove all zoom-with-reuse methods from `StateSnapshot` *instances*; they don't work!
    This now means that there's only one way to zoom-with-reuse which is from the `StateSnapshot` *object*, and it's
    nice to have just one, uniform way of doing this. If you don't understand what this means have a look at the
    updated example: https://japgolly.github.io/scalajs-react/#examples/state-snapshot-2
  * Add `StateSnapshot.withReuse.prepareViaProps`
  * Add `StateSnapshot.withReuse.prepareViaCallback`

* Add an optional field to `TriStateCheckbox` props: `disabled: Boolean` which, when true, renders a disabled
  checkbox that is read-only.

* Add `code: String` to `SimEvent.Keyboard`

* Add `async` variants to all of the `MonocleReact` extensions

  (Example: `$.modStateAsyncL(State.someLens)(f): AsyncCallback[Unit]`)
