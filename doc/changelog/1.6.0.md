## 1.6.0

* Router bugfix: explicit fallbacks to conditional routes weren't executing

* Added the following top-level convenience functions:

    ```scala
    val preventDefault: ReactEvent => Callback
    val stopPropagation: ReactEvent => Callback
    val preventDefaultAndStopPropagation: ReactEvent => Callback
    ```
