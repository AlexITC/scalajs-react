## 1.6.0

* [Breaking change] Bugfix: when using `.componentDidCatch` you used to use:

    ```scala
    .error : raw.React.Error
    .info  : raw.React.ErrorInfo
    ```

  There are two problems here:

  1. It turns out that the `raw.React.Error` type isn't really a thing; instead it's the raw exception itself.
  2. Having two raw values to pass around isn't consistent with the rest of the library. There should be one Scala-based
     value that encapsulates the raw inputs.

  Therefore this has changed so that you now use:

    ```scala
    .error: ReactCaughtError

    // which has the following fields (plus a few more):
      .componentStack     : String
      .jsError            : Either[Any, js.Error]
      .message            : String
      .name               : String
      .stack              : String

    // in addition to the raw inputs from React:
      .rawError           : js.Any
      .rawInfo            : raw.React.ErrorInfo
    ```

* Router bugfix: explicit fallbacks to conditional routes weren't executing

* New `ext-cats-effect` module that provides `cats-effect` type class instances for:
  * `Sync[CallbackTo]`
  * `Effect[AsyncCallback]`

* Added the following top-level convenience functions:

    ```scala
    val preventDefault: ReactEvent => Callback
    val stopPropagation: ReactEvent => Callback
    val preventDefaultAndStopPropagation: ReactEvent => Callback
    ```
* Dependency upgrades:
  * monocle 2.0.1
  * sourcecode 0.2.0
