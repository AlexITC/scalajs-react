## 1.7.6

* Add an implicit `Reusability[Range]` instance
* Add `Reusable.emptyCallback: Reusable[Callback]`
* Prefix all members in `Reusability.TemporalImplicitsWithoutTolerance` by `reusability`
* Add `Reusability.MapImplicits` which you can now import to enable implicit `Reusability` instances for `Map`s
* Add conversions between `Option[Reusable[A]]` <=> `Reusable[Option[A]]`
  * If you have a `Option[Reusable[A]]`, call `Reusable.sequenceOption`
  * If you have a `Reusable[Option[A]]`, call `.sequenceOption`
* `SimEvent` classes now have an `assign(tgt: js.Dynamic, readOnlyProperties: Boolean = false): tgt.type` method to
  populate a provided object-like value. (Useful for generating native events for testing.)
* Add many more `SimEvent.Keyboard` definitions. All keys on a standard US keyboard are now covered.
* Improve accuracy of pre-defined `SimEvent.Keyboard` values
* Add convenience methods `CallbackTo` for getting the current time:
  * `now: CallbackTo[Instant]`
  * `currentTimeMillis: CallbackTo[Long]`
  * `nanoTime: CallbackTo[Long]`
* Add `.timeout(timeLimit)` to `AsyncCallback` instances so that you can limit the amount of time to wait for the async
  procedure to complete.
* Add `StateAccess.const(F[S]): StateAccess[F, S]`

* The `untypedRef` vdom attribute wasn't usable previously. It's now fixed and there are two ways of using it.

  To just provide a `DOM => Unit` function, use `.apply` like this: `<.input(^.untypedRef(myRefVar = _))`

* Add a new way of creating VDOM refs.
  There are two differences between the established way, and this new way:

  1. It sacrifices some type-safety for flexibility.
     You can declare a ref to an `<input>` and apply it to a `<select>`.
     When the types don't line up, the ref simply rejects the dom it's passed.
     If you misuse this you won't get a runtime error, it will just be as though you didn't wire up the ref at all.
  2. Decoupling of control. With type-safe refs, you create the ref and apply it in the same class.
     With this new "untyped" ref, you can pass the ref around and have a completely different part of the code wire it
     up to vdom.

  Usage:

  ```scala
  val ref = Ref.toVdom[html.Input]

  // and then elsewhere

  <.input(^.untypedRef := ref)
  ```

* Upgrade dependencies
  * scalajs-dom 1.1.0
  * scala-collection-compat 2.2.0
  * Scala.JS 1.2.0
