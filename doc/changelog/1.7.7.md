# 1.7.7

This entire release is focused on `AsyncCallback`.

* `AsyncCallback` instances:

  * Added `fork` and `fork_` which run the async computation in the background.

    The result of `fork` gives you access to `await: AsyncCallback[A], isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` which you can
    use to join back up with it again later.

    `fork_` on the other hand, returns nothing and is effectively fire-and-forget.

* `AsyncCallback` object:

  * Added `countDownLatch(count: Int)` which returns an `AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch`.
    It has the same purpose and semantics as Java's `CountDownLatch`.

    ```scala
    AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch {
      countDown : Callback
      await     : AsyncCallback[Unit]
      isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]
      pending   : CallbackTo[Int]
    }
    ```

* `AsyncCallback.Barrier`:

  * Added `isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` to synchronously query whether the barrier is complete or not.

  * Renamed `waitForCompletion` to `await`.
    `waitForCompletion` is still available but will result in a deprecation warning.
    Automatic migration is below.


## Migration
