# 1.7.7

This entire release is focused on `AsyncCallback`.

* `AsyncCallback` instances:

  * Added `fork` and `fork_` which run the async computation in the background.

    The result of `fork` gives you access to `await: AsyncCallback[A], isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` which you can
    use to join back up with it again later.

    `fork_` on the other hand, returns nothing and is effectively fire-and-forget.

  * Added duration measuring methods that exist on `Callback`:

    ```scala
    def withDuration[B](f: (A, FiniteDuration) => AsyncCallback[B]): AsyncCallback[B]
    def logDuration    (fmt: FiniteDuration => String)             : AsyncCallback[A]
    def logDuration    (name: String)                              : AsyncCallback[A]
    def logDuration                                                : AsyncCallback[A]
    ```

* `AsyncCallback` object:

  * Added `def awaitAll(as: AsyncCallback[_]*): AsyncCallback[Unit]` to wait for a number of async processes to complete.

  * Added `countDownLatch(count: Int)` which returns an `AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch`.
    It has the same purpose and semantics as Java's `CountDownLatch`.

    ```scala
    AsyncCallback.CountDownLatch {
      countDown : Callback
      await     : AsyncCallback[Unit]
      isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]
      pending   : CallbackTo[Int]
    }
    ```

  * You can now add a `_` suffix to the following to return an `AsyncCallback[Unit]` and be more efficient under-the-hood:

    * `traverse`
    * `sequence`
    * `traverseOption`
    * `sequenceOption`

  * The argument to `throwException` is now by-name

  * Added `def throwExceptionWhenDefined(o: => Option[Throwable]): AsyncCallback[Unit]`

* `AsyncCallback.Barrier`:

  * Added `isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` to synchronously query whether the barrier is complete or not.

  * Renamed `waitForCompletion` to `await`.
    `waitForCompletion` is still available but will result in a deprecation warning.
    Automatic migration is below.


## Migration

```sh
find . -type f -name '*.scala' -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/\bwaitForCompletion\b/await/g;
