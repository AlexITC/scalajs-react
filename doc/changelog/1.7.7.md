# 1.7.7

This entire release is focused on `AsyncCallback`.

* `AsyncCallback.Barrier`:

  * Added `isComplete: CallbackTo[Boolean]` to synchronously query whether the barrier is complete or not.

  * Renamed `waitForCompletion` to `await`.
    `waitForCompletion` is still available but will result in a deprecation warning.
    Automatic migration is below.


## Migration

```sh
find . -type f -name '*.scala' -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/\bwaitForCompletion\b/await/g;
' {} +
```
