## 1.7.7

This entire release is focused on `AsyncCallback`.

* In `AsyncCallback.Barrier`, renamed `waitForCompletion` to `await`.
  `waitForCompletion` is still available but will result in a deprecation warning.
  Automatic migration is below.


### Migration

```sh
find . -type f -name '*.scala' -exec perl -pi -e '
  s/\bwaitForCompletion\b/await/g;
' {} +
```
