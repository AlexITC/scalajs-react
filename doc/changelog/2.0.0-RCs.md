# Changes in RC1

[See here.](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/blob/v2.0.0-RC1/doc/changelog/2.0.0.md)

# Changes in RC2

* Bugfix in the `useCallbackWithDeps{,By}` hook

* Changed the pattern in hook signatures from `(mainArg: => A, deps: => D)` to `(deps: D)(mainArg: D => A)`.
  Affected methods:
  * `useCallbackWithDeps{,By}`
  * `useEffectWithDeps{,By}`
  * `useLayoutEffectWithDeps{,By}`
  * `useMemo{,By}`

# Changes in RC3

* Bugfixes:
  * Expose default sync effect instead of internal type in:
    * `SetStateFn(…)`
    * `ModStateFn(…)`
    * `ModStateWithPropsFn(…)`
  * `StateSnapshot` constructors should accept
    * `SetStateFn`
    * `ModStateFn`
    * `ModStateWithPropsFn`
  * `TimerSupport.install` had an infinite loop
  * `TriStateCheckbox`'s `onKeyDown` handler was calling `event.preventDefault()` on unhandled keys
  * Fix the Scala 3 version of `renderBackend` to support polymorphic backends
    *(e.g. `renderBackend[Backend[X]]` where `X` is a type already in scope)*
  * Support `CallbackOption[Unit]` being passed directly to event handling vdom

* Additions:
  * `TriStateCheckbox` now accepts an optional `Reusable[TagMod]` in its `Props` that will be applied to the `<input>`
  * Add `.dispatch` to `Callback` and `AsyncCallback` which schedules (-and-forgets) the callback to be run in the background

* Upgrade deps
  * Cats-effect to 3.2.2
  * Scala.js to 1.7.0
  * Microlibs to 3.0.1
  * UnivEq to 1.6.0

# Changes in RC4

* Support turning React warnings into runtime exceptions. There are a few ways to do this:
  * Via a [new config option](../CONFIG.md#testwarningsreact) for `ReactTestUtils`
  * [Manually](../TESTING.md#fatal-react-warnings)

* Document existing `debounce` methods to clarify you need to save them as a `val` and reuse them

* Add:
  * `AsyncCallback.debounce(duration): AsyncCallback[Unit]`
  * `Callback.debounce(duration): Callback`
  * `ScalaFnComponent.withReuse{,By}`
  * `ScalaFnComponent.withChildrenAndReuse{,By}`

* `ReactTestUtils` is now a `trait` as well as an `object` so that you can mix it into your own test utils collection

* Upgrade deps
  * Cats-effect to 3.2.9
  * Microlibs to 4.0.0
  * Scala.js to 1.7.1
  * scalajs-dom 2.0.0
  * UnivEq to 2.0.0

# Changes in RC5

* Add a new bundle called `core-bundle-cb_io` with provides core scalajs-react functionality with `Callback` as the default sync effect and `cats.effect.IO` as the default async effect. (Thanks [@rpiaggio](https://github.com/rpiaggio))
